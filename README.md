RioDB is a very fast program for inspecting data streams in real-time.

We are working to make it as easy as possible for developers to create bots that inspect data streams and take action when a pattern is matched. 
Some use cases include:

Fraud detection  
Market trading (bids/offers)  
Amazon retail store bot  
Infrastructure monitoring  
Videogame cheater detection  
Network survailance  
Fleet monitoring  
Utilities supply/demand  
Telecom robotcaller detection  
Health sciences research  

"Tell me when."
